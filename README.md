# romeo-and-juliet

## Question 1 - Algorithms and Data Structures
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Included with this assignment is the file Romeo-and-Juliet.txt. It is a classic tale of family, death
and forbidden love! Write an application that will read this file and generate a list of all word
occurrences. Label each word with the frequency with which it is used. The application should
display the results in a TableView / RecyclerView ordered from most to least frequently used.
Extra credit: Build a control that allows the table view to sort itself instead alphabetically or
by character length of the word.
